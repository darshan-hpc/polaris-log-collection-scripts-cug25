## Plotting overall Polaris Darshan coverage

First, you need to download the job scheduler datasets from the [ALCF Public Data repository](https://reports.alcf.anl.gov/data/polaris.html). Specifically, the 'ANL-ALCF-DJC-POLARIS_2024...' and 'ANL-ALCF-DJC-POLARIS_2025...' datasets.

**darshan-job-id-extracter.sh**

Next, you need to compile the list of job IDs that Darshan captured logs for. This can be done by running the `darshan-job-id-extracter.sh` script as follows:

`darshan-job-id-extracter.sh <log_collection_directory> > <jobid_file>`

Note that you must pipe the output into a file (`<jobid_file>`) that is used by subsequent analysis scripts.

**jobs-analyze.py**

Next you need to generate the monthly job stats CSVs for all jobs and for Darshan covered jobs using the `jobs-analyze.py` script.

`Usage: jobs-analyze.py <2024_jobs_csv> <2025_jobs_csv> <darshan_job_ids_file>`

The first 2 arguments are the yearly ALCF job scheduler datasets downloaded above and the third argument is the Darshan job IDs file generated by the `darshan-job-id-extracter.sh` script.

This script will generate 2 CSVs used by the plotting script: all_job_stats.csv and darshan_job_stats.csv.

**plot-all-node-hours.py**

This script can just be executed with no arguments, it does not require any arguments as it looks directly for the CSVs generated by the `jobs-analyze.py` script.
