**find-interesting-jobs-stdio.py**

This script analyzes aggregate STDIO job data to find interesting jobs to analyze. In particular, it prints out the 10 highest intensity jobs (in terms of total bytes).

`Usage: python find-interesting-jobs-stdio.py <job_stats_dir>`

`<job_stats_dir>` is the directory containing all the CSV files generated by the `extract-job-stats.py` script.

The job in Case Study 2, 1977553-17460120447186390966.darshan, was selected for being the highest intensity job identified by this script.

The log file is included here for convenience. A PyDarshan job summary report can be generated to reproduce I/O cost and I/O operation count figures, Figure 7 and Figure 8, respectively.

`python -m darshan summary 1977553-17460120447186390966.darshan`

**analyze-intensive-user.py**

`Usage: analyze-intensive-user.py <job_stats_dir>`

`<job_stats_dir>` is the directory containing all the CSV files generated by the `extract-job-stats.py` script.

This script summarizes aggregate STDIO statistics, as well as contributions by this particular intensive user. This data is used in Table 3.
