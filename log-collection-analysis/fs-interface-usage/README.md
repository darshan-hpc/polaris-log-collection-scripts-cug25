**extract-fs-interface-data.py**

This script calculates aggregate job statistics to each storage system using each interface. The results are stored in a CSV file (fs_interface_usage.csv) that is fed to other plotting scripts.

`Usage: python extract-fs-interface-data.py <job_stats_dir>`

`<job_stats_dir>` is the directory containing all the CSV files generated by the `extract-job-stats.py` script.

**plot-interface-bars-bytes.py**

This script plots CDFs of observed performance by all jobs for each interface. It also prints the 50th, 75th, 90th, and 99th percentiles of observed performance for each interface.

`Usage: python plot-interface-bars-bytes.py <job_stats_dir>`

`<fs_interface_usage>` is the path to the CSV generated by `extract-fs-interface-data.py`.
